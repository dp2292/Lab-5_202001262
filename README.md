Software engineering Lab 5 Submission

In this lab I will do static analysis of the codes.

For doing static analysis I will be using Pylint Tool.

## Installation of Pylint Tool

Pylint is a widely-used tool for analyzing Python code quality and detecting errors, potential bugs, and other issues. It is a popular static code analysis tool that can check the adherence to coding standards, identify potential bugs, and suggest refactoring to improve code quality. Pylint analyzes the source code of Python programs and generates reports on its quality, including code complexity, coding standards adherence, unused code, and many other metrics. It can be integrated with various IDEs and text editors, such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and Sublime Text, to provide real-time feedback on code quality.

For the static analysis I will be using multiple python files found online.
